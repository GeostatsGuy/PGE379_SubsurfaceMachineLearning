# PGE379_SubsurfaceMachineLearning
## Course in subsurface machine learning.

Instructor: Michael Pyrcz

PGE 379 / 383 – Subsurface Machine Learning
Unique I.D.: PGE 379 18850 / PGE 383 TBD 

*“You will learn the theory and practice of data analytics and machine learning for subsurface resource modeling”.*

We will build from the ground up covering fundamental probability and statistics; inference (clustering, multidimensional scaling) and prediction (regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines and neural nets); model training, testing, tuning and validation; and workflows for integrating many features; workflows for anomaly detection, spatiotemporal prediction, and uncertainty integration and communicating results within a project team to impact subsurface decision making.

The course is cross listed as an undergraduate (PGE 379) and graduate course (PGE 383).  Lectures are the same, the assignment will vary for undergraduate and graduate variants.  

**Course Online**: The course lectures are recorded on posted on YouTube and the example workflows are available on GitHub for anyone to follow along.

**Prerequisites**: Admission to an appropriate major sequence in engineering, geoscience or consent of instructor.  Students must be willing to learn and use Basic Python and Statistical and Machine Learning Python Packages to complete assignments and participate in class.  Basic Python use will be covered in the first couple of lectures and well-documented workflows and hands-on will be provided to support the students (Jupyter Notebooks).  

MEETS:			MWF 11:00am – 12:00am, at CPE 2.202

**COURSE OBJECTIVES**:

You will gain:

1.	Data Analytics: fundamental probability, statistics, data preparation, summarization and visualization prerequisites for modeling
2.	Spatiotemporal Inference: approaches for learning from data, discovering and communicating relationships 
3.	Spatiotemporal Prediction: knowledge and experience with a variety of parametric and nonparametric models 
4.	Model Checking: methods to train, test and tune subsurface models
5.	Uncertainty Modeling: methods to quantify, integrate and summarize uncertainty 
6.	Communicating Model Results: maximizing the impact of your modeling work by communicating modeling results to inform decision making
7.	Practical Workflows: a wide variety of practical workflows that you will build from to kick-start your successful career in the subsurface digital revolution.
