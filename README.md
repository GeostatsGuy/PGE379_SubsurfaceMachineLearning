# PGE379_SubsurfaceMachineLearning
Course in subsurface machine learning.
PGE 379 / 383 – Subsurface Machine Learning
Unique I.D.: PGE 379 18850 / PGE 383 TBD 

“You will learn the theory and practice of data analytics and machine learning for subsurface resource modeling”.

We will build from the ground up covering fundamental probability and statistics; inference (clustering, multidimensional scaling) and prediction (regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines and neural nets); model training, testing, tuning and validation; and workflows for integrating many features; workflows for anomaly detection, spatiotemporal prediction, and uncertainty integration and communicating results within a project team to impact subsurface decision making.

The course is cross listed as an undergraduate (PGE 379) and graduate course (PGE 383).  Lectures are the same, the assignment will vary for undergraduate and graduate variants.  

Prerequisites: Admission to an appropriate major sequence in engineering, geoscience or consent of instructor.  Students must be willing to learn and use Basic Python and Statistical and Machine Learning Python Packages to complete assignments and participate in class.  Basic Python use will be covered in the first couple of lectures and well-documented workflows and hands-on will be provided to support the students (Jupyter Notebooks).

Note: the final will be an optional, no-risk final.  Students may choose to write it to improve their course grade.  If the result of the final is lower than the pre-final term result, it will be thrown out.

COURSE OBJECTIVES:

You will gain:

1.	Data Analytics: fundamental probability, statistics, data preparation, summarization and visualization prerequisites for modeling
2.	Spatiotemporal Inference: approaches for learning from data, discovering and communicating relationships 
3.	Spatiotemporal Prediction: knowledge and experience with a variety of parametric and nonparametric models 
4.	Model Checking: methods to train, test and tune subsurface models
5.	Uncertainty Modeling: methods to quantify, integrate and summarize uncertainty 
6.	Communicating Model Results: maximizing the impact of your modeling work by communicating modeling results to inform decision making
7.	Practical Workflows: a wide variety of practical workflows that you will build from to kick-start your successful career in the subsurface digital revolution.
ASSIGNMENT POLICY:

Late assignments are not accepted, unless reasonable excuse (sickness, interview etc.) and advanced notification. 


ACADEMIC DISHONESTY:

Academic dishonesty is a serious breach in the code of ethics for both The University of Texas and for the engineering and geoscience disciplines.  Disciplinary actions will be taken against any student who is involved in any form of academic dishonesty.  I do not expect to have to confront this issue.  Students are free to consult each other on the written and coding assignments, but each must submit their own independent work.

DISABILITIES:	

The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.  Please notify me of any accommodations and I’ll be happy to assist.


COURSE ENVIRONMENT / STUDENT SUPORT:

I am committed to fostering a positive learning environment that welcomes all to learn. I’m very open to student feedback and to adjust the course delivery to maximize value to the students. I’m also interested to ensure the course presents a reasonable workload. I build and complete my own assignments in an effort to make sure they are reasonable, if anything seems onerous come see me. I’m happy to help, discuss anytime. Please discuss with me if there are any issues and / or refer to UT Austin resources on Title IX, counselling and mental health services, writing center etc.
